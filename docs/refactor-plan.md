# Etsy Inventory App Refactoring Plan
*Created: May 7, 2025*

This document outlines the plan for refactoring the Etsy Inventory application to improve code organization, maintainability, and documentation.

## Overview

The Etsy Inventory App currently manages inventory across Etsy and Shopify platforms with core functionality for syncing products and orders. This refactoring effort aims to:

- Improve code organization by introducing a service layer
- Enhance documentation with JSDoc comments
- Standardize error handling across the application
- Create consistent API client wrappers for marketplace interactions
- Implement a testing framework for key components

## Refactoring Tasks

### 1. Add JSDoc Comments to Existing Code ⬜
**Status: Planned**

**Description:** Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to models, utility functions, and route handlers to document parameters, return values, and behaviors.

**Key Areas:**
- Models (product.js, order.js, settings.js)
- Utility functions in the utils/ directory
- Route handlers in the routes/ directory

**Concerns:**
- Ensure comments are accurate and reflect current functionality
- Balance between documentation coverage and verbosity

### 2. Create a Service Layer ⬜
**Status: Planned**

**Description:** Extract business logic from route handlers into dedicated service modules to improve separation of concerns and code reusability.

**Services to Create:**
- services/product-service.js - Product and inventory management operations
- services/order-service.js - Order processing and management
- services/sync-service.js - Marketplace synchronization logic
- services/auth-service.js (refactored from existing utils)

**Implementation Steps:**

- Move existing business logic from route handlers to appropriate service modules
- Ensure route handlers will use the new service layer
- Add JSDoc comments to document service methods

**Concerns:**
- Ensure consistent error handling across services
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing functionalities
- Avoid code duplication during the transition

### 3. Standardize Error Handling ⬜
**Status: Planned**

**Description:** Implement a consistent approach to error handling across the application with custom error classes and centralized error handling middleware.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Create custom error classes in utils/errors.js
- Update services and route handlers to use these custom error classes
- Enhance the existing error handling middleware to support different error types
- Implement consistent error logging using the existing logger

**Custom Error Classes:**
- ApiError - For external API failures (Etsy, Shopify)
- ValidationError - For data validation failures
- DatabaseError - For database operation failures
- AuthenticationError - For authentication/authorization issues
- NotFoundError - For resource not found scenarios

**Concerns:**
- Ensuring backward compatibility with existing error handling
- Balancing useful error details without exposing sensitive information
- Integrating with the existing logger for consistent error tracking

### 4. Create API Client Wrappers ⬜
**Status: Planned**

**Description:** Develop structured API client wrappers for Etsy and Shopify to standardize API interactions and improve error handling and logging.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Create utils/etsy-api-client.js and utils/shopify-api-client.js
- Refactor existing API calls to use these client wrappers
- Implement error handling and rate limiting
- Add logging for all API interactions

**Key Features:**
- Authentication management
- Rate limiting and backoff strategies
- Consistent error handling
- Comprehensive logging
- Support for both REST and GraphQL (for Shopify)

**Concerns:**
- Managing effective API rate limit handling
- Handling authentication token refresh mechanisms
- Ensuring backward compatibility with existing code

### 5. Implement Testing Framework ⬜
**Status: Planned**

**Description:** Add unit and integration tests for core functionality to improve reliability and make future refactoring safer.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Set up Jest as the testing framework
- Create test utility functions in a tests/utils/ directory
- Add unit tests for service and utility functions
- Implement API mocks for testing external integrations

**Initial Testing Focus:**
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Unit tests for service layer functions
- Integration tests for critical workflows

**Concerns:**
- Creating effective mocks for external APIs
- Ensuring test coverage for critical paths
- Managing test data and database interactions

## Implementation Timeline
- JSDoc Comments: ✓ Completed
- Service Layer: ✓ Completed
- Error Handling: ✓ Completed
- API Client Wrappers: ✓ Completed
- Testing Framework: Ongoing (2-3 weeks)

## Progress Tracking

| Task                 | Status    | Started      | Completed    | Notes    |
|----------------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| JSDoc Comments       | Planned   | -            | -            |          |
| Service Layer        | Planned   | -            | -            |          |
| Error Handling       | Planned   | -            | -            |          |
| API Client Wrappers  | Planned   | -            | -            |          |
| Testing Framework    | Planned   | -            | -            |          |

## Difficulties and Concerns

**Challenges:**
- Successfully separating business logic from route handlers
- Standardizing error handling across the application
- Improving documentation with comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Creating consistent API clients for marketplace interactions
- Implementing comprehensive test coverage
- Ensuring all routes properly use the service layer
- Maintaining performance while adding additional abstraction layers

**Potential Risks:**
- New abstractions might introduce performance overhead
- Some edge cases may be missed during refactoring
- Testing strategy needs to be comprehensive to catch regression issues
